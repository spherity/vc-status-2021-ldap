      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the majority of cases, businesses already implement some known revocation
        approaches.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of these "known" options is the usage of directory services such
        as Active Directory that provides the access to records via
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol'>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        An issuer of verifiable credentials in such a system
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] can use a pointer to a particular location at
        directory service inside of verifiable credential, that
        a verifier can check to see if a credential has been revoked.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#data-model">Data Model</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes for each item.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance"></section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The following terms are used to describe concepts in this specification.
      </p>

      <div data-include="./terms.html" data-oninclude="restrictReferences"></div>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Process Flow</h2>

        Here we describe the assumptions in this usage of an underlying directory
      service, which leverages LDAP to obtain records of revocation
        status for a given verifiable credential.
        <br>
        <br>
        First of all, entire verifiable credentials issued by an issuer
        are not assumed to be recorded in directory service by default.
        Some subset of information, however, need to be retained for revocation to be
        executed later, i.e. the pointer to where a revocation record will be posted
        if that credential is revoked later. This record can contain more or less
        information, but it is assumed this record at least exist to claim credential
        status as revoked.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of a given credential's revocation, a respective record becomes
        publicly accessible and a data of this record can be returned via an LDAP URL that
        can be be securely and deterministically constructed via the following list of
        properties of a verifiable credential:
        <ul>
          <li>credentialStatus.ssl</li>
          <li>credentialStatus.host</li>
          <li>credentialStatus.query</li>
          <li>credentialStatus.params</li>
        </ul>
        If a record is returned by the query assembled from these variables, thereafter,
        this verifiable credential should be considered as revoked and any additional
        information will be included in the returned message.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
        The following sections outlines the data model for this document.

          When an issuer desires to enable revocation for a
          verifiable credential, they MAY add a <code>status</code>
          property that uses the data model described in this specification.

      <h2>Validation Algorithm</h2>

      <p>
        This process MUST be followed to identify revocation status of
        verifiable credential that includes RevocationStatus2021LDAP
        method as value for its credentialStatus.type property. This
        identifies it as relying on underlying LDAP directory service.
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
          Build a fully qualified LDAP URL by securely combining properties
          from credentialStatus section of a verifiable credential.
        </li>
        <li>
          Execute LDAP search operation using LDAP URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluate results of LDAP search operation.
          <br>
          <br>In case error code 32 (not found) is thrown, then the status
          of a verifiable credential should be considered as not rovoked.
          <br>
          <br>In case LDAP search operation results are recieved, then the status
          of a verifiable credential should be considered as revoked.
          <br>
          <br>If present, LDAP search results MAY include an object with
          description property. If present, description property
          MUST be a string.
          <br>
          <br>If present, LDAP search results MAY include an object with
          date property. If present, date property MUST be a date
          as ISO-formatted string or UNIX Epoch milliseconds as number.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <h2>Correlation</h2>

      <p>
        This method is best suited for fully public or semi-public credentials;
        potentially leaking status information is assumed to be an acceptable
        risk, and recent, signed data about current status of a verifiable
        credential is assumed to be "authoritative" over other or older records,
        which this method is not optimized to minimize.
      </p>

      <p>
        Referencing the verifiable credential's unique ID in the LDAP
        query string adds additional correlation risk, which may be an
        anti-pattern in some use cases.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
      aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
      not understanding the implications of this section can result in
      security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
      advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
      critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our architecture assumes keys are managed in common across both issuance
      and status-publication infrastructure. The latter is assumed to be secured
      by LDAPS; LDAP-specific security is assumed and largely out of scope of
      this specification, although LDAP queries are stored in the credential in
      both composed and decomposed form to assure validation and comparison to
      better secure queries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further research would be needed on how (or whether it is worthwhile) to
      sign the specific status object and how to verify the relationship between
      signing key of same and issuance key of original VC. A signed envelope
      around the status object returned (or even a fully-formed credential
      issued against a published schema) is definitely one possibility, for
      use-cases where metadata passed along with status would be complex, or
      need to be secured additionally.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
      aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
      standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
      this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
      to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
      all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
      especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
      have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
      aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
      standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
      difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
      languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
      specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
