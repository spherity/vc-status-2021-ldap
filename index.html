      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the majority of cases, businesses already implement some known revocation 
        approaches for particular business cases.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of these "known" options is the usage of directory services such 
        as Active Directory that provides the access to records via 
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol'>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)<a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        An <a>issuer</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> in such a system
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] can use a pointer to a particular location at 
        <a>directory service</a> inside of <a>verifiable credential</a>, that 
        a <a>verifier</a> can check to see if a credential has been revoked.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Process Flow</h2>

        Here we describe the assumptions in this usage of an underlying <a>directory 
        service</a>, which leverages <a>LDAP</a> to obtain records of revocation 
        status changes for a given <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        First of all, <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a> 
        are not being recorded in <a>directory service</a> by default. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of its revocation, a respective record becomes publicly 
        accessible via LDAP URL that should be securely constructed via 
        <a>credentialStatus.protocol</a>, <a>credentialStatus.host</a>, 
        <a>credentialStatus.query</a>, <a>credentialStatus.params</a> 
        properties of the <a>verifiable credential</a>. Thereafter, this 
        <a>verifiable credential</a> should be considered as revoked.

        <p>
          When an <a>issuer</a> desires to enable revocation for a
          <a>verifiable credential</a>, they MAY add a <code>status</code> 
          property that uses the data model described in this specification.

                query for the <a>verifiable credential</a> revocation status 
                location. Numbers that are present inside brackets identify

        <li>
          Apply LDAP URL parts (protocol, host, query, params) to construct 
          <a>credentialStatus</a> section as described in the example above. 
          Build the value of <a>credentialStatus.id</a> property by combining 
          LDAP URL parts into a single LDAP URL string.
